Q1) Role of Frontend FE

Frontend is the part of a web application that users see and use directly. It focuses on how the website looks and how users interact with it.

User interface : 
    Frontendd is responsible for designing the layout colors buttons text images and overall look of the website. It makes sure the website is easy to understand and pleasant to use.

User interaction :
    Frontend handles user actions like clicking buttons filling forms scrolling pages and navigating between screens. It gives instant feedback like showing errors loading messages or success messages.

Communication with backend :
    Frontend sends user data to the backend using requests and receives data from the backend. It displays that data on the screen in a readable format for the useer.


Q2) Role of Backend BE

Backend is the part of the web application that works behind the scenes. Users do not see it directly but it handles all the core work.

Server side processing :
    Backend processes requests sent from the frontend. It applies logic decides what action to take and prepares responses to send back.

Database handling :
    Backend stores reads updates and deletes data in the database. For example user details product data and orders are all managed by the backend.

Security and authentication:
    Backend handles login signup password protection and access control. It ensures only authorized users can access certain data or features.

Q3) Business Logic

Business logic is the set of rules that decides how a web application behaves. It controls what is allowed and what is not allowed in the system.

Business logic is applied between frontend and database. It makes sure data is processed correctly according to business rules.

Examples
In an online shopping app business logic checks if a product is in stock before allowing purchase.
In a banking app business logic checks account balance before allowing money transfer.
In a food delivery app business logic decides delivery charges based on distance and order value.

Q4) Client Server Model

Client server model is a way of organizing how web applications work.

Client :
    The client is the user side application like a web browser or mobile app. It sends requests and shows responses to the user.

Server:
    The server is the system that receives client requests processes them and sends back responses. It contains backend code and database access.

Communication:
    The client sends a request to the server using the internet. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.

Q5) Three Tier Architecture

Three tier architecture divides a web application into three layers to make it organized and easy to manage.

Presentation layer:
    This is the frontend layer. It shows the user interface and collects user input.

Application business layer:
    This layer contains business logic. It processes data applies rules and decides how the system should behave.

Data layer:
    This layer manages the database. It stores and retrieves data.

Why it is used:
    It makes the application scalable easy to maintain and secure. Each layer can be changed without affecting the others.

Q6) JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is used as a backend language because it is fast flexible and widely supported.

Performance:
    JavaScript uses non blocking operations which makes it handle many users at the same time efficiently.

Ecosystem:
    JavaScript has a large number of libraries and tools that help developers build applications faster.

Popular backend frameworks:
    Node.js is the main runtime used for backend JavaScript. Express.js and Nest.js are popular frameworks used to build backend applications.
